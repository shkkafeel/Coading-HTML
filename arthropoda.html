        <div1 id="div1">
        Scientific name: Arthropoda
        Phylum: Arthropoda; Gravenhorst, 1843

    <h2>Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Arthropoda is the largest phylum with about nine lakh species.
        </li>
        <li>
            They may be aquatic, terrestrial or even parasitic.

        </li>
        <li>
            They have jointed appendages and a chitinous exoskeleton.

        </li>
        <li>
            This phylum includes several large classes and contains the class Insecta <br>which itself represents a
            major portion of the animal species in the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            They possess the ability to survive in every habitat.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>

        <br>
        <ol type="1"> 
            <li>The body is triploblastic, segmented, and bilaterally symmetrical.</li>
            
            <li>They exhibit organ system level of organization.</li>
            
            <li>The body is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen.</li>

            <li>Their body has jointed appendages which help in locomotion.</li>

            <li>They have an open circulatory system.</li>

            <li>The head bears a pair of compound eyes.</li>

            <li>The exoskeleton is made of chitin.</li>

            <li>The terrestrial Arthropods excrete through Malpighian tubules while the aquatic ones excrete through green

            <li>They have a well-developed digestive system.</li>

            <li>They respire through the general body surface or trachea.</li>

            <li>They contain sensory organs like hairs, antennae, simple and compound eyes, auditory organs, and statocysts.</li>
